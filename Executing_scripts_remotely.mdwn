In LDTP you can execute the test scripts from a remote location. Say, the ldtp execution engine can run on a remote test server and you can execute the test scripts from your development box. 

Steps to follow: 

Start LDTP engine (manually) in remote location with the following options 

$ ldtp

Default port 4118

$ ldtp **-p 4118**

or 

$ ldtp **--port=4118**

from remote machine, in shell, you need to set LDTP_SERVER_ADDR with the remote server IP address or resolvable machine name (DNS entry). 

**export LDTP_SERVER_ADDR=xx.xx.xx.xx** 

If port number is changed in the ldtp server, then LDTP_SERVER_PORT environment variable has to be set 

**export LDTP_SERVER_PORT=12345** 

Now start executing the test scripts using ldtprunner or from a python prompt or from a shell. 

* $ python testscript.py 
* $ python 
   * >>> from ldtp import * 
   * >>> click ("*-gedit", "btnFind")
