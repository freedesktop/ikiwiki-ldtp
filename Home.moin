GNU/Linux Desktop (GUI Application) Testing Project (GNU LDTP) is aimed at producing high quality test automation framework and cutting-edge tools that can be used to test GNU/Linux / Solaris Desktop and improve it. It uses the '''Accessibility''' libraries to poke through the application's user interface. The framework also has tools to record test-cases based on user-selection on the application. GNU LDTP is a GNU/Linux / Unix GUI application testing tool. It runs on GNU/Linux / Solaris / FreeBSD / Embedded environment ([http://www.access-company.com/about/opensource/contributions.html Palm source]).

GNU LDTP core framework uses ''Appmap'' and the recorded ''test-cases'' to test an application and gives the status of each test-case as output. As of now, GNU LDTP can test any GNOME application based GUI applications, which are accessibility enabled, Mozilla, Openoffice.org, any Java application (should have a UI based on swing) and KDE 4.0 applications based on QT 4.0 (based on the press releases by KDE).

We encourage you to join the project and help us to create robust, reliable and stable test tool/framework for Unix Desktops. Thanks to '''GNOME''' Accessibility team and '''Sun Microsystems''' Accessibility team for their great work and their continuous support !!!
