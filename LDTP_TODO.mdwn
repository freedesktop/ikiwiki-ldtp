##### Port LDTP to Python from existing C implementation - http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360928

We have initial code checked in to the GIT repository, though this code path will not be executed by default. 


##### Improve LDTP recording

Check [[Recording TO DO|RecordTODO]] 


##### Populate widget information in LDTP editor - Will be useful for the script writers

Similar to at-poke / accerciser, but with the information based on LDTP naming convention.
