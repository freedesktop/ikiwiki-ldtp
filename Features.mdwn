## LDTP Features

         * LDTP concepts are derived from [[Software Automation Framework Support|http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/Default.htm]] 
         * LDTP supports verification of actions performed (guiexist, verifystate, etc) - [[API Reference|Docs]] 
         * Writing test scripts are very easy, the script writer need not know about the object hierarchy 
         * CPU / Memory performance monitoring of application-under-test can be measured - [[Class_pstats|Class_pstats]] 

## Deprecated

         * From the XML log, we can gather [[HTML report|http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/ldtp-dev/2005-October/000031.html]] using XSLT 
         * Group based execution, which provides precise control on the flow of test-script execution - [[ldtprunner_XML|ldtprunner_XML]] 
         * Scripts can be written as a reusable component and for that the data can be stored / retrieved in XML - [[Data_XML|Data_XML]] 
         * User-friendly Text Editor with syntax highlighting for generating and grouping test data [[Howto_use_LDTP_Editor|Howto_use_LDTP_Editor]] 
         * Objects are identified both [[statically|http://gnomebangalore.org/ldtp/index.php/Howto_generate_Application_map]] and [[dynamically|http://gnomebangalore.org/ldtp/index.php/Remap]] 
         * [[Record / Playback|RecordHOWTO]]
